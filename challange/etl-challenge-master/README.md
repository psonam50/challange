### Problem:
- You have a vendor that delivers 2 files (`data.csv`, `headers.txt`) every day at 6AM UTC. 
- Here you are provided the files in the root path as if they were already downloaded from an external source (e.g. S3 or SFTP).
- One file contains the raw pipe-delimited data (`data.csv`) without a header row.
- The other file (`headers.txt`) contains the headers in the same order as the data in `data.csv`, but each header is a separate row. 
E.g. the first column in `data.csv` is `Order ID`, the next is `Order Date` and so on.
- Write a program that takes the data from both files, transforms into a single CSV file with both header row and data, and finally loads it into a database using the provided function.
- Use the class provided in `src/main.py`, start your code in the class's `run` function, and write as if this were production-ready code. 
- We are not using a real database here, so just pretend that the Database class's `load_file` function handles everything for us.

Note: use Python >= 3.7 to solve and do not use any other packages or dependencies (e.g. Pandas). The goal is to show us your coding style
and see how you would approach the problem using plain Python. This should not take more than 1 hour to complete.
